# Word-Identifier

Word-Identifier
Program uses neural network to identify the types of words in a sentence. At this time the dictionary is incomplete and only contains the most common words in the english language. Additionally the training file is incomplete and does not train for all words in the dictionary. Results may not be accurate.

In the future the training file will be expanded substantially to train for as many words as possible.

Getting started:
Download the repository. Navigate to directory in bash shell and enter 'make' to compile program. Then enter ./a.out to run program. More directions will be given during runtime.

Pre-requisites:
The makefile uses g++, if you have a compiler you'd rather use, enter '*.cpp' after the compiler command and the program should compile.
